# STREUSLE 3.0->4.0 updating

This branch contains scripts and files used to prepare the 4.0 release. Most will not be part of the release itself. 
DO NOT MERGE with master.

The dev branch of the UD_English repository is included as a submodule. 
This is so the STREUSLE packaging scripts can use the not-to-release/sources/reviews 
directory to obtain UD trees (including up-to-date lemmas).
It should not be a submodule of the master branch.
